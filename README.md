ROS 2-Driven Collaborative Robots for Precision Disease Management and Chili Harvesting
Agri-Bots represent a significant advancement in agricultural robotics,
designed to automate critical tasks such as the harvesting of chilies and the detection of plant diseases
on chili farms. This project harnesses a range of cutting-edge technologies to create a robust and
efficient system that enhances precision and productivity in farming operations. By employing OpenCV,
the system is capable of identifying perfectly ripened chilies and detecting plant diseases early, ensuring
that only the best produce is harvested while maintaining crop health. The robot’s plucking and
spraying tasks are performed by a robotic arm operating under advanced inverse kinematics
algorithms, allowing for highly precise actions.
The robot is equipped with ROS 2, which facilitates smooth navigation and independent coordination
across the farm. A notable achievement of this project has been the integration of the Intel RealSense
D455 Depth Camera into the ROS platform, which enhances mapping and localization within the
agricultural environment. This capability allows Agri-Bot to autonomously manage navigation and
make data-driven decisions in real-time, significantly improving overall efficiency.
Currently, the robotic arm’s inverse kinematics are implemented using the MoveIt framework, and it
can perform tasks at specific positions and orientations. Ongoing enhancements aim to increase its
flexibility and accuracy for diverse harvesting scenarios. The communication between Agri-Bot's subcomponents is managed by the Jetson Nano board, an energy-efficient computing platform that
supports real-time data processing and control. This setup enables the robot to operate with minimal
latency, executing complex tasks autonomously and efficiently.
Agri-Bot is designed to address major agricultural challenges such as labour shortages and the need for
more efficient farming practices. By reducing operational costs, increasing productivity, and improving
the quality of chili crops through the integration of advanced technologies, Agri-Bot marks a significant
leap forward in agricultural automation. It sets a new benchmark for robotic farming and paves the way
for future advancements in the industry.
